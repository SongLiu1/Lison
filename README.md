# Grid

This program is written by Java on Myeclipse2014, to run this project

1) You could choose to install myeclipse or eclipse, and then simple import the project 
   and run functions/Test.java. In built-in console, you can test it
   (In this way, you could also read the code with much former organized)
2) Otherwise, you could run Grid.jar file by the following steps:
   (1) In cmd, entering the directory that you store Grid.jar file
   (2) run the following command "java -jar Grid.jar" 
   The drawback is that you have to read the code in plain text file

Thanks. If you have any problem while running my code, please let me know.
